    "### Version 1: Docker Containers for Each Individual Workshop\n",
    "\n",
    "The first iteration of the *Coffee and Code* platform consisted of individual [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers (one from which the instruction is provided, a second *playground* container that workshop participants could experiment with) and associated workshop materials that were maintained in separate [repositories](https://github.com/unmrds) within the UNM RDS GitHub organization. \n",

    "#### A Docker Primer\n",
    "\n",
    "Containerization is the process of defining the software components required to run a specific application. In the context of a Docker-based containerization process this definition is written into a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is then used to create a Docker Image. That Docker Image can then be used as the basis for one or more separate Docker Containers, or as the starting point for defining a new Dockerfile.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Version 2: A Single Orchestrated Docker Environment That Automatically Contains Current Versions of All Workshops\n",
    "\n",
    "To streamline the preparation and presentation of the workshops we adopted the [*Docker Compose*](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) approach of defining a single configuration file that could be used to run multiple containers from a single command. This significantly streamlined the deployment of updated versions of the workshops and accelerated our development and testing cycle for workshop content.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Multiple Containers defined using *Docker Compose*](CoffeeAndCodeToGo.png)\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "![Business Plan](![image.png](attachment:image.png))\n",
    "\n",
    "the process of replicating our instruction and learning platform is a simple three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install the [Docker Platform](https://docs.docker.com/install/) including *Docker-compose* on your computer. \n",
    "2. Download the current *Coffee and Code* platform from the UNM RDS [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-content-platform) by either *cloning* the repository using a local copy of the Git distributed version control system, or by simply downloading the [ZIP archive](https://github.com/unmrds/cc-content-platform/archive/master.zip).\n",
    "3. Run the `docker-compose` command to build (the first time) and spin up the containers. Once they are running the instruction and learning platform can be interacted with through a web browser. "
