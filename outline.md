## Description

C&C is a monthly workshop series which offers participants an opportunity to engage with current technologies in an environment that promotes a shared focus on research data management. As the series moves into its second year, the workshop architecture has evolved to promote portability and deployment of the series within a server or desktop environment. Librarians will describe the updated architecture and upcoming session topics for the 2018-19 academic year.
